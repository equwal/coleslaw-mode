* 0.3.0
Coleslaw-mode has been rewritten. It is now much simpler to use and setup.
- defcustom variables for defaults
- No need for `(coleslaw-setup)`. Instead, a user can include auto-insert, or define a key for insertion.
- This no longer is a "mode." No mode is defined.
- Magic alist is used to change to a decent major mode, or it is left as the normal-mode.
- A number of bugfixes; for example, newlines are placed after each form, instead of before, which keeps the cursor at the next point where the skeleton will insert.

* 0.2.5
- Pulled code from [[https://github.com/RomanHargrave][Roman
  Hargrave]]'s branch.
- Made the dispatcher external.

* 0.2.4
- checkdoc, package-lint, flycheck all done for melpa submission.

* 0.2.3
- Dropped =M-;= keybinding, since coleslaw does what it needs to when
  opening a new file.

* 0.2.0
- Test framework in tests.el.
- Skeleton now does error checking on user input, and asks before
  inserting superfluous headers.
- Date auto-inserts the current date in ISO8601 (2000-01-01 style)
  format.

* 0.1.3 2019-06-16
- One-key interface (bound to =M-;=) now is
  =coleslaw-insert-header-or-dispatch=. Should only be needed when
  changing a files mode in the =format:=, to redispatch the modes.
- Easier control over mode dispatch using
  =coleslaw-default-format-modes=.
- Changed the lighted to =CSLAW=.
- Dispatchment on old files based on the =format:= field.
- Use different separators with =coleslaw-header-separator=.

* 0.0.1
- Skeleton on open, with mode dispatch (but no mode dispatch on nonfresh
  files).
